Consent management allows you to track and verify user authorization for data sharing. Teal provides default consent terms, or you can create custom terms tailored to your business requirements.

## Consent Terms

Consent terms define the legal text that users agree to when granting access to their data.

### System Terms vs Custom Terms

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **System Terms** | Default terms provided by Teal, available to all clients. Identified by `is_system_term: true`. |
| **Custom Terms** | Terms created by your organization for specific use cases. Identified by `is_system_term: false`. |

### Categories

Each term belongs to a category that defines the type of consent:

- **one_time** - Single authorization for a specific action (e.g., one-time income verification)
- **recurring** - Ongoing authorization for continuous data access (e.g., recurring payroll checks)

### Retrieving Available Terms

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.sandbox.goteal.co/consents/terms' \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>'
```

Filter by type using query parameters:

```bash
# Get only system terms
GET /consents/terms?is_system_term=true

# Get only recurring terms
GET /consents/terms?consent_category=recurring

# Combine filters
GET /consents/terms?is_system_term=true&consent_category=recurring
```

### Creating Custom Terms

If system terms don't meet your requirements, create custom terms:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sandbox.goteal.co/consents/terms \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
    "name": "Custom Data Sharing Agreement",
    "consent_text": "I authorize Example Corp to access my payroll data for income verification purposes.",
    "consent_category": "recurring"
  }'
```

The `consent_version` is automatically assigned and incremented for each new term you create.

### One Active Term Per Category

Only one term can be active per category at any time. When you create a new term for a category, any existing active term in that category is automatically deactivated.

**Example:**
1. You have an active `recurring` term (version 1)
2. You create a new `recurring` term
3. The old term (version 1) is automatically set to `is_active: false`
4. The new term (version 2) becomes the active `recurring` term

This ensures there's never ambiguity about which term users should accept. Users who previously accepted the old term will need to re-consent to the new term (see [Re-consent Flow](#re-consent-flow)).

## Recording Consent

When a user accepts consent terms, record their acceptance:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sandbox.goteal.co/consents \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
    "user_id": "95a0e70b-fe02-4f47-aef9-2efff279df71",
    "term_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36"
  }'
```

The user's IP address is automatically captured from request headers for audit purposes.

### Consent Record

Each acceptance creates an immutable record containing:

- **id** - Unique consent record identifier
- **user_id** - The user who gave consent
- **term_id** - The specific term version accepted
- **ip_address** - Captured from request headers
- **user_agent** - Browser or application identifier
- **accepted_at** - Server timestamp of acceptance
- **status** - `active` or `revoked`

## Validating Consent

Before performing actions that require consent, verify the user has accepted the current active terms.

### Check User's Consent Status

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.sandbox.goteal.co/consents/95a0e70b-fe02-4f47-aef9-2efff279df71' \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>'
```

### Validation Logic

A user has valid consent when:
1. They have a consent record with `status: active`
2. The associated term has `is_active: true`

If the user's consent points to a term where `is_active: false`, they have accepted an outdated version and need to re-consent.

## Re-consent Flow

When you create a new term version, the old term is automatically deactivated (see [One Active Term Per Category](#one-active-term-per-category)). Users who accepted the old term will need to re-consent.

### Flow

```
1. Create new term
   → Old term automatically set to is_active: false
   → New term becomes is_active: true

2. Check user's consent:
   - GET /consents/{user_id}
   - If their term's is_active = false, they need re-consent

3. Prompt user to review and accept new terms

4. Record new consent:
   - POST /consents with new term_id

5. Old consent record preserved for audit trail
```

### Example: Detecting Outdated Consent

```bash
# 1. Get current active term
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.sandbox.goteal.co/consents/terms?consent_category=recurring&is_active=true' \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>'

# 2. Get user's consents
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.sandbox.goteal.co/consents/95a0e70b-fe02-4f47-aef9-2efff279df71' \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>'

# 3. Compare: if user's term_id doesn't match current active term, prompt for re-consent
```

## Revoking Consent

Users can revoke their consent at any time. Revocation preserves the record for audit purposes.

```bash
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://api.sandbox.goteal.co/consents/7f3b8c2a-1d4e-5f6g-7h8i-9j0k1l2m3n4o/revoke \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>'
```

After revocation:
- The consent record's `status` changes to `revoked`
- The `revoked_at` timestamp is set
- The record is preserved for compliance and audit purposes
