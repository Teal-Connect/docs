## Overview

Teal's HMRC integration enables you to retrieve verified income and employment data directly from His Majesty's Revenue and Customs. This provides a reliable, government-sourced view of a user's financial history, ideal for income verification, lending decisions, and affordability assessments.

### Data Available

Through the HMRC integration, you can access:

| Data Type | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Employment Income** | Total income and earnings from each employer |
| **Tax Paid** | Tax deducted at source for each employment |
| **Employer Details** | Names of employers on record |
| **Income Period** | The tax year or period the data covers |

### Use Cases

Confirm employment income directly from HMRC records rather than relying on payslips alone

### How It Works

1. Create an account connection with `payroll_provider` set to `hmrc`
2. The user authenticates via the HMRC Government Gateway
3. Teal retrieves income submissions across available tax years
4. Access the data via `GET /hmrc/{user_id}` or manage entries via `/hmrc/entries`

## Creating an HMRC Connection

To establish an HMRC connection, call `POST /accounts` with `payroll_provider` set to `hmrc`. HMRC requires additional authentication parameters in `extra_login_params`.

### Required Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `unique_tax_reference` | The user's UTR is a 10 or 13-digit number. They can find it on their Business Tax Account, the HMRC app, tax returns, or other documents from HMRC. It may appear as 'UTR', 'reference', or 'official use'. |
| `ni_number` | The user's National Insurance number. They can find it on their payslip, P60, or letters from HMRC. |

### Example Request

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.sandbox.goteal.co/accounts \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "user_id": "95a0e70b-fe02-4f47-aef9-2efff279df71",
  "payroll_provider": "hmrc",
  "extra_login_params": {
    "unique_tax_reference": "2622992714",
    "ni_number": "GJ458274B"
  }
}'
```

Once the account is created, the response will include an `authorisation_url`. The user must complete OAuth authentication via this URL, which redirects them to the HMRC Government Gateway. After successful authentication, you can fetch and retrieve income data using the [`/hmrc` endpoints](/api-reference/hmrc/get).
