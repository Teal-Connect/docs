The Organization Members API allows you to manage members within your organization.
Members represent users who have access to your organization's resources via the web console.

> **Note:** While all member management functionality is available through these API endpoints and nothing prevents you
from building your own dashboard or managing Members via API, it is more convenient to manage Organization Members
using Teal's web console.

Use these endpoints to:
- Create new organization members
- Retrieve member information
- List all members in your organization
- Delete members
- Authenticate members with sign-in functionality
