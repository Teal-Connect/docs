**Direct Connection Requirements**
These fields are required for direct connections to happen. Provide one of these identity sets:
1. `ni_number` plus at least one of `forename`, `surname`, `post_codes`, or `dob`.
2. All four fields `forename`, `surname`, `post_codes`, and `dob` without `ni_number`.

If neither set is provided, direct connection validation will fail.
